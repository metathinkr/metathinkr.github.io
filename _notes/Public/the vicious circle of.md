# The Vicious circle of loosing people

- it starts from you being alone
- You find someone
- Befriend
- You say a commitment
- Your circumstances change
- You don't honor
- You also had an option to inform in prior
- But you behave senselessly, becuz you feel, you don't have any one to oblige to, since it was stuck in your mind that you are a loner, and you don't have any responsibility to any person, You never changed the logic or flow of actions which should have had kicked into action on such incident. You didn't had the fresh **mind-set** that you need to update your *'response algo'* in response to change in your *status*.
