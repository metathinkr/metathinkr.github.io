# I have seen curiosity doing the same thing as courage…

but also note that it not curiosity alone that acts like courage, foolishness and senselessness also act like courage.

It is so grave to realise that which we may refer to as courage of xyz person, can not necessarily be the *real*  courage.

I think this thought is closely related to [[speaking to anybody]]
