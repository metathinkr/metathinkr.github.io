    Welcome to my working notes - a personal knowledge space made for thinking, learning and ideation. 
    It's a collection of atomic, ever-growing notes that I keep updating as I gain more clarity over the topic. 
    If notes don't make much sense to you - I am sorry, and if it does make sense, do let me know your thoughts!

    Also, here are <a href="/writing" style="color:var(--link);">a few handpicked notes.</a>
